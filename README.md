# PAY.S.A.P.

Welcome to PAY.S.A.P.: A location based payment and invoicing platform!

Working for yourself comes with it's own unique set of challenges, and getting paid shouldn't be one of them! I created this app with the intent of solving this, a problem I was all too familiar with as a 10 year freelancing veteran. The goal of PAY.S.A.P. is to modernize and streamline both the payment and business processes for freelance and independent contractors.

## Application Features

A user can: 

* log in/create a new account/log out
* see graphs plotting their total montly income as a freelancer, payments made a client, a comparison of the two, and their expenses. All charts are responsive and adjust dynamically on new user input
* add, edit, and delete expenses as well as filter by category and date range
* export data from their expense table, closed client jobs table, and closed freelance jobs table to an Excel spreadsheet
* create a new job as a client, and can update or delete any of these open client jobs
* see all of their upcoming freelance jobs plotted on a map with a marker giving them the description, time and address of the job
* get their current location. If it is after the start time of the job and within range of the job address a user can either complete their day rate job, or start the timer and complete their hourly job
* see their account balance reflect the payments from completed freelance jobs 
* upload, view, and email copies of pdf documents
